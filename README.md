An HTML converter, as the name suggests, is a program developed to accommodate the increasing demand for an easy way to post files of various formats onto websites. An HTML converter is lightweight software developed with the sole purpose of converting documents (mostly text or PDF) into HTML code and preserving their original formatting, so that they can then be easily uploaded to the Internet. HTML converters have significantly helped amateurs and non-professionals to quickly and successfully accomplish text-to-HTML conversion.
